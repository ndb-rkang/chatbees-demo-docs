## About

Welcome to ChatBees, AI Powered Chat Platform for your internal knowledge base! ChatBees helps you easily build an LLM application with your internal knowledge base. ChatBees summarizes information and gets insights through automated analysis of all your data. This helps users get a comprehensive understanding of either a single or all their data sources, including files, websites, Google Docs, Notion, etc.

## Slack/Discord Bots

To highlight the capability we have developed Slack/Discord Bots. The bots are tailored to assist teams in obtaining instant, high-quality answers to the questions on their servers. You don't need any coding expertise to set up and utilize the bots. In just a few clicks, you can deploy a Slack/Discord bot, train it with your documents, and content, or with responses in the chat. One use case is to utilize the bot for frequently asked questions on the Slack or Discord server reducing the workload for moderators.
