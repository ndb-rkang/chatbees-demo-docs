# /beestore command

The `/beestore Question: How is your day? Answer: Very good.` command allows you to store a specific question and answer pair to the bot. This will improve the bot's ability to answer related question. This could be used when the user does not get a good answer for a question, due to the missing or out-of-date information in the uploaded documents. It is recommended that you store frequently asked questions this way.

> The "Question: " and " Answer: " are reserved keywords for /beestore command. Please make sure you follow the format.
