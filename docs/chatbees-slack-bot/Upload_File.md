# Upload File

After the bot is installed in the slack workspace, click ChatBees under Apps, Drag and Drop documents to the bot. The bot will store the documents.

> ChatBees bot does not share documents or information between slack workspaces. Any document uploaded will only be available within the workspace.

> Only Admins are allowed to drop the documents to the bot.

Currently we support a maximum file size of 10 MB and the following content types
- PDF (.pdf)
- Plaintext (.txt)
- CSV (.csv)
- Markdown (.md)
- Microsoft Words (.docx)
 

> Documents have to be uniquely named.  If one document is uploaded with a name that is the same as one already uploaded, it will replace that document.
